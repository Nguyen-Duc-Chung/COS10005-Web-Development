                Tidal energy production is still in its infancy. The amount of power produced so far has
                been small. There are very few commercial-sized tidal power plants operating in the world.
                The first was located in La Rance, France. The largest facility is the Sihwa Lake Tidal 
                Power Station in South Korea. The United States has no tidal plants and only a few sites 
                where tidal energy could be produced at a reasonable price. China, France, England, Canada, 
                and Russia have much more potential to use this type of energy.
